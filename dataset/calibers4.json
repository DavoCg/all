This allows three snails connected with these mechanical display elements to separately sample the number of hours, ten-minute intervals, and minutes to be acoustically indicated.\n\nThe energy needed by the striking mechanism is provided by the mainspring. When the strikework is activated, the ratchet wheel is uncoupled from the winding train. Therefore, the ratchet wheel can turn freely and power the striking mechanism. This also prevents the winding train including the crown from turning during the repeater sequence, which would imply a loss of energy.\n\nTo guarantee the flawless interaction of the complex mechanical ensemble, elaborate safety and blocking mechanisms have been integrated into the movement. While the repeater is working, the switching action of the numerals discs is delayed. At the same time, the crown cannot be pulled and consequently, the time cannot be set. This precaution prevents any interference with the strikework sampling sequence and ensures that the acoustic indication of time precisely corresponds with the digitally displayed time. At 12:59 hrs when the longest series of tones is struck, it takes about 20 seconds until the repeater sequence has ended.","brand_id":"a-lange-and-sohne","base":null,"reference":"L043.5","movement":"Handwound","display":"Digital","diameter":37.7,"jewels":93,"reserve":36,"frequency":18000,"hands":"Small Seconds, Jumping Hours, Jumping Minutes","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","additionals":"Constant Force Mechanism","id":"a-lange-and-sohne-l0435"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/a-lange-sohne/l043-8-6e.jpg","description":"The A.

Its third complication is the patented stop-seconds mechanism. Thanks to this device, the tourbillon – and with it the entire movement – can be stopped and restarted to one-second accuracy.\n\nApertures in the three-quarter plate expose the fusée-and-chain transmission, which is so complex that it is rarely implemented in wristwatches. The owner can observe how the intricate 636-part chain unwinds from the mainspring barrel onto the fusée while the watch is being wound. The fusée-and-chain transmission is one of the most effective complications when it comes to increasing the rate accuracy of a mechanical watch. It is one of the tenets of physics that the power generated by a spring is high when it is fully tensioned and significantly weaker as it nears the fully unwound state. This can cause rate-accuracy fluctuations. The fusée-and-chain transmission works like an infinitely variable gearbox. It equalises the waning force of the gradually relaxing mainspring and makes sure that the movement always receives a constant amount of energy.","brand_id":"a-lange-and-sohne","base":null,"reference":"L072.1","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":33.6,"jewels":32,"reserve":36,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Chain & Fusée, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"a-lange-and-sohne-l0721"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/a-lange-sohne/l082-1-e7.jpg","description":"Automatic movement with tourbillon escapement and perpetual calendar.

The balance occupies the position of the sun. The moon can be seen through a round aperture in the celestial disc.\n\nIn slightly more than 29.5 days, the moon orbits the earth once – in an anti-clockwise direction. A planetary wheel train assures that the moon phase is always correctly displayed. The mechanism is engineered to such a high degree of accuracy that it takes 1058 years before a correction by one day is required.\nIn the middle of the celestial disc, the earth disc rotates through 360 degrees once a day. It is daytime on the half that faces the sun (the balance) and night-time on the other. The peripheral 24-hour scale provides a rough time-of-day reference for regions in the northern hemisphere.\n\n\nA constant-force escapement inside the calibre L096.1 movement controls the delivery of the enormous amount of energy stored in the twin mainspring barrel to assure a consistently high rate of accuracy across the entire 14-day power reserve period. In ten-second intervals, this mechanism releases a consistently identical portion of the available energy to the balance, thus assuring that the torque remains constant.

The readily visible chronograph-rattrapante mechanism merely suggests the overall complexity of the movement: the grande sonnerie and perpetual calendar mechanisms are located beneath it, largely concealed. All movement parts are lavishly finished by hand. Particular emphasis is placed on levers, rockers and springs, which are black-polished by the finisseurs. The latter polishing steps alone require more than a month of manual work. Endowed with solarisation, the mainspring barrel provides a power reserve of 30 hours.\n\nThe grande sonnerie is especially daunting for the watchmaker. He is not only responsible for precisely adjusting the switching sequences of the individual parts but also for the richness of the sound. Tuning is performed exclusively by hand and “by ear”. The grand and small strikes automatically indicate the time in quarter-hour intervals. When the slide at 8 o’clock is actuated, the minute repeater will indicate the time to one-minute accuracy. The acoustic time is mechanically sampled from three so-called snails in the middle of the movement. The low-pitched tones indicate the hours, the high-pitched ones the minutes and the double tones the quarter-hours. The striking mechanism has its own spring barrel, which delivers enough power for 24 hours.\n\nWith its 248 parts, the split-seconds chronograph mechanism is the most complex ensemble of this watch. Operated by the two push pieces on the top left and right sides of the case flank, it can measure the duration of an event any number of intermediate times. The chronograph and rattrapante functions are controlled by two separate column wheels. A mechanical rarity, the flying-seconds mechanism indicates fractions of a second in a subdial of its own. Its specially designed escapement assembly includes a wheel with 30 teeth and a five-pointed star. These elements allow the hand to perform its movements as fast as lightning and with the utmost precision. The energy needed for this rare additional chronograph function is so considerable that a third spring barrel is needed to deliver it.\n\nThe perpetual calendar mechanism emulates the Gregorian calendar. Not only does it know how many days each month has in the course of a year, it is also aware of the fact that February has 29 days in leap years. It needs to be adjusted by one day – in 2100 for the first time – because the Gregorian calendar omits the 29th of February in centenary years that are not divisible by 400. The duration of each month is coded into a 48-segment wheel with recesses that are mechanically sampled by the date switching lever. The deeper the recess, the shorter the month.","brand_id":"a-lange-and-sohne","base":null,"reference":"L1902","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":40.5,"jewels":67,"reserve":30,"frequency":18000,"date":"Date, Day, Leap Year, Month, Perpetual Calendar","chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Rattrapante, Foudroyante","hands":"Hours, Minutes","astronomical":"Moonphase","acoustic":"Grande Sonnerie, Minute Repeater, Petite Sonnerie","id":"a-lange-and-sohne-l1902"},{"picture":"","description":"Caliber L1924 is a hand-wound movement with time in hours and minutes, small seconds with stop seconds, and jumping sweep seconds with start/stop function through a pusher.

But when rotated by a tourbillon or a carrousel, they pass through all vertical positions in succession, cancelling out these inaccuracies.\n\nA tourbillon consists of a rotating carriage; a carrousel, in contrast, consists of a platform on which the balance wheel and its bridge go round like a wooden horse on a merry-go-round, the reason for its name.\n\nBlancpain has achieved a world first by reviving this complication, almost forgotten for more than a century, and using it in a wristwatch.

The zero-reset system for the counters and the central sweep seconds hand is handled by progressive-contact hammers guaranteeing optimal precision. It ensures smooth yet firm activation of the timing-related components via a vertical coupling clutch. This was the exceptional base mechanism chosen to house the perpetual calendar of the L.U.C Perpetual Chrono.\n\nThis calendar is recognisable by its large twin-aperture date display, complemented by indications of the day, the month and the leap or non-year nature of the year, while the finishing touches are set by a day/night indication and an orbital moon-phase display. The latter guarantees graphic and accurate readings of the age of the moon, with a mere one-day deviation in 122 years. Since the original configuration of this calendar uses the same areas as the chronograph – both involving indications at 3 and 9 o’clock – the architecture of the perpetual calendar had to be adjusted to offset the day/night indicator by a few millimetres.

Journe Quantième Perpétuel is very easy to use. All corrections are made using the three-position crown, except for the rapid correction of months, which is carried out by a protected and hidden corrector lever beneath the lug at 1 o’clock, thus facilitating the adjustment over four years without any specific tool. The months with 28, 29, 30 and 31 days are automatically taken into account and leap years recognized with years 1, 2 and 3 shown in black; 4 for the leap year shown in red in the center of the dial under the hour and minute hands.\n\nThe automatic winding movement of the Quantième Perpétuel by F.P.Journe Invenit et Fecit is manufactured in 18K rose Gold, like that of all the brand’s precision chronometers. It is constructed on the basis of the exclusive Octa calibre 1300.3, with an identical caliber leaving room to insert all the complications of the Octa line. It also features the exclusive off-center F.P. Journe rotor in 22K red gold that offers optimal winding of the watch for an effective power reserve with retrograde indication for over 120 effective hours. It winds the movement in only one direction with an autoblocant ball bearing system (self-blocking).

Each of the two balances alternately serves as exciter and resonator. When the two balances are in motion, they enter into sympathy due to the effect of resonance and begin naturally beating in opposition. The two balances thus rest against each other, giving more inertia to their movement. Nonetheless, this harmony is possible only if the difference in frequency between them does not exceed five seconds per day of cumulated difference in six situations. Adjusting them is an extremely delicate task.\n\nF.P.Journe offers a new face to the renowned Chronomètre a Résonance, acclaimed by collectors and professionals of the brand worldwide. In an ultimate quest for precision, the dial at 9h now offers a time indication of 24 hours, defining precisely the hours of day and those of night.

Its system ensures precise, error free control of the chronograph operation. The column wheel is designed to reduce stress on the clutch and lever, minimizing impact on the movement when the start/stop button is pushed.\n\nA vertical clutch system was created to prevent the second hand from jumping when the stopwatch START button is pressed. In the vertical clutch system, when the stopwatch START button is pressed, the start-stop lever opens, the fourth wheel and the clutch ring are engaged by the pushing force of the clutch spring, and the stopwatch begins to measure time.\n\nAchieving a level of stopwatch accuracy equivalent to the accuracy of the Spring Drive caliber itself would not have meant much if this accuracy were lost in the operation of the stopwatch. To minimize time measurement errors when the chronograph buttons are pressed, the operation of the buttons was made as precise as humanly possible. A two-step READY/START mode was adopted to ensure that the stopwatch operation would be error-free. It is the same mechanism as is used in Seiko’s hand held stopwatches for professional sports use. The chronograph enters READY mode when the push button is lightly pressed. A further press then starts the stopwatch.","brand_id":"grand-seiko","base":null,"reference":"9R86","movement":"Spring Drive","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":30,"reserve":72,"frequency":null,"date":"Date","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Additional 24 Hour Hand (adjustable)","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"grand-seiko-9r86"},{"picture":"","description":"Caliber 9R96 is a self-winding movement with column-wheel chronograph and GMT function, based on Seiko's Spring Drive technology.\n\nAs in conventional mechanical watches, the sole power source of Spring Drive is a mainspring that can be wound by the motion of an oscillating weight or by winding the crown.

As well as the superior hardness and durability of stainless steel compared to the more generally used steel and brass, the metal gleams when polished to a mirror finish. Achieving superlative finishes in stainless steel is no easy task: polishing the hard metal takes a master watchmaker up to four times longer than polishing more commonly used brass. \n\nAs with the immaculately finished movement bridges, the tourbillon cage is crafted in stainless steel. Three days are required just for the hand finishing of the tourbillon components. A highly-polished stainless steel sleeve around the tourbillon draws further attention to the beautiful escapement by reflecting the oscillating balance wheel and the rotations of the escape wheel and tourbillon cage. \n\nNormally a central seconds hand requires a friction spring to prevent small fluttering caused by play in the gear train. But for the Parallax Tourbillon, the Grönefeld brothers developed the movement with an added pinion and wheel so that the energy-sapping friction spring is not required. The latter feature improves power transfer to the regulator, contributing to the impressive power-72-hour power reserve.","brand_id":"gronefeld","base":null,"reference":"G-03","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":27,"reserve":72,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Tourbillon Escapement, Crown Position Indicator","id":"gronefeld-g-03"},{"picture":"","description":"HMC 200 automatic calibre\nDiameter: 32.0 mm or 14 1/4 lines\nHeight: 5.5 mm\nFrequency: 21,600 Vib/h\n27 jewels\nAutomatic bi-directional pawl winding system\nEngraved oscillating weight\nPower reserve: minimum 3 days\nHacking seconds\nOriginal Straumann® Hairspring with flat overcoil\nFinish with Moser stripes","brand_id":"h-moser-and-cie","base":null,"reference":"HMC 200","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":30,"jewels":27,"reserve":72,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","id":"h-moser-and-cie-hmc-200"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/moser/copy-of-hmc-346-9d.jpg","description":"In-house automatic calibre HMC 230\nDiameter: 30.0 mm or 13 1/4 lignes\nHeight: 4.7 mm\nFrequency: 21,600 Vib/h\nAutomatic bi-directional pawl winding system\nRotor with the H.

Thanks to the use of this high-tech material, they are virtually wear-free. The efficient automatic winding system builds up a power reserve of at least 60 hours in the mainspring. The indexless balance with a flat coil oscillates at a frequency of 4 hertz (28,800 beats per hour), ensuring a high level of precision.

The constant-force mechanism consists of a spring, known classically as a remontoir d’égalité, that is periodically re-armed by the mainspring and acts as a secondary power source to protect the regulating organ of the movement. This regulates the motion of the minute wheel, creating a jumping minutes hand that offers greater precision in time display. More significantly, the mechanism that controls the minute strike also follows this one-minute jumping system, which completely eliminates the chiming error that can occur when the repeater is activated between minutes, when the chime played and the time shown can be one minute apart.\n\nThe most common configuration of the perpetual calendar mechanism can only be adjusted in one direction, but the Master Grande Tradition Gyrotourbillon Westminster Perpétuel emphasises the experience and convenience of the user, and its date can be adjusted forwards or backwards without harming the movement. The pointer-style date indication further reinforces the precision aspect of the timepiece, as it jumps over the tourbillon aperture in order to provide the best possible view of the visually stunning rotating escapement.","brand_id":"jaeger-lecoultre","base":null,"reference":"184","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":137,"reserve":52,"frequency":28800,"date":"Date, Leap Year, Month, Year Indicator","hands":"Hours, Minutes","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","additionals":"Constant Force Mechanism, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"jaeger-lecoultre-184"},{"picture":"","description":"Mechanical automatic winding movement, 471 parts, 21,600 vibrations per hour, 45-hour power-reserve.\nFunctions: hour, minute, minute repeater with pause reduction system, flying tourbillon with a flying balance, peripheral automatic winding system.","brand_id":"jaeger-lecoultre","base":null,"reference":"362","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":72,"reserve":45,"frequency":21600,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Foudroyante Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"jaeger-lecoultre-362"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/jaeger-lecoultre/380a-a8.jpg","description":"Mechanical manually-wound movement, 445 parts, 21,600 vibrations per hour, 2 independent barrels each with 50-hour power-reserve.\nFunctions: hour, minute, central seconds, power-reserve.

Our CALIBER I is an honest tribute to this heritage, emphasizing typical elements not only of function, but also of beauty.\n\nBig shining rubies, set in gleaming gold chatons, create a balanced contrast to the silver finished plate. Even the smallest of the stones, the one holding the lever anchor in place, is set in gold chatons and secured by deeply blued steel screws. The meticulous black, hand-polished chamfer finishing of the anchor bridge and the balance cock as well as the slit golden screws of the balance wheel creates charming reflections of light.\n\nThe ultimate in beauty, however, is the sparkling diamond that crowns the balance. It is majestically placed on top of the hand-engraved balance cock, in perfect with the elegant swan-neck fine adjustment. The balance spring is bent markedly upward in its last winding to ensure the smooth pulse of the shock-resistant gold screw balance wheel.\n\nCALIBER I is equipped with a second hand stop mechanism. When the crown has been pulled out, a spring gently bends itself around the balance shaft and the second hand stops, hence permitting the watch to be set accurately to the second.","brand_id":"lang-and-heyne","base":null,"reference":"L&H Caliber 1","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":36.6,"jewels":19,"reserve":46,"frequency":18000,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","id":"lang-and-heyne-landh-caliber-1"},{"picture":"","description":"","brand_id":"lemania","base":null,"reference":"1873","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":27,"jewels":18,"reserve":40,"frequency":null,"chronograph":"Chronograph","hands":"Small Seconds, Hours, Minutes","id":"lemania-1873"},{"picture":"","description":"Chronograph movement with central minute counter.

This movement can be easily set manually using the crown, or through its innovative Flash Setting function. Flash Setting is what makes fast and direct time setting possible without using the crown, while providing rigorous precision in displayed time. The system relies on the user’s smartphone and dedicated application but requires no external connection, such as WiFi or Bluetooth. The information recorded in the application is transmitted via light sequences emitted by the smartphone’s flash to a tiny opening on the watch dial, concealed in the number 12.

Consisting of 152 components and with 21 jewels, the P.1000 calibre is solid, strong and reliable, and it is immediately recognisable as a Panerai calibre from both the technical and aesthetic points of view. To ensure maximum security and stability, the balance is held by a bridge with two supports, fixed by screws with threaded rings for micrometer adjustment of the height. The oscillation frequency is 4 Hz (28,800 vibrations per hour). With the small seconds dial at 9 o’clock – another of the distinctive characteristics of many contemporary Panerai watches, directly descended from the historic models – the new movement also contains the device which stops the balance and zeroes the seconds hand (seconds reset) when setting the time, for perfect synchronization of the watch with the reference signal.","brand_id":"panerai","base":null,"reference":"P.1000","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":26.8,"jewels":21,"reserve":72,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","id":"panerai-p1000"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-1000-10-a7.png","description":"Skeletonized version of P.1000.

The technology is revealed in the top-end characteristics of the calibre: with a diameter of 13¾ lignes (31 mm) and three spring barrels which give the watch a power reserve of ten days, the movement has 25 jewels and a balance which makes 28,800 vibrations per hour (4 Hz). The main functions are hours, minutes, small seconds, date and linear indication of the remaining power reserve at 6 o’clock while a central arrow hand enables the time in a second time zone to be read, with the relative AM/PM indication on the counter at 9 o’clock.

The P.2004 calibre is a hand-wound mechanical movement with a power reserve of 8 days. It is a single-button column wheel chronograph which combines the start/stop/ reset functions in a single push-piece. This push-piece is positioned at 8 o’clock in order to maintain the unmistakable appearance of Luminor watches, with the bridge protecting the winding crown, a distinctive feature of the design of Luminor cases. Its position also allows the most immediate control of the operations of the chronograph when making time measurements. The chronograph seconds hand is at the centre with the 30-minute counter at 3 o’clock, enabling the measurements themselves to be clearly read. But the heart of the movement consists of the sophisticated system for controlling the chronograph functions: the column wheel, a characteristic feature of high-quality chronographs, ensures the greatest precision in starting, stopping and resetting the chronograph hands. It is also equipped with the GMT function. The case back of the Panerai Luminor 1950 8 Days Chrono Monopulsante GMT reveals the structure of the movement with its separate bridges, their brushed finish with chamfered edges and the polished screws. It is available with a brushed steel, titanium or ceramic case.\n\nThe movement was updated to feature 30 jewels in 2018.","brand_id":"panerai","base":"panerai-p2002","reference":"P.2004","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":37.8,"jewels":29,"reserve":192,"frequency":28800,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Monopoussoir","hands":"Additional 12 Hour Hand (adjustable), Additional 24 Hour Hand (fixed), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"panerai-p2004"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-2004-1-88.png","description":"In-house monopoussoir chronograph movement with 8 days of power reserve and additional timezone.","brand_id":"panerai","base":"panerai-p2004","reference":"P.2004/1","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":37.8,"jewels":29,"reserve":192,"frequency":28800,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Monopoussoir","hands":"Additional 12 Hour Hand (adjustable), Additional 24 Hour Hand (fixed), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"panerai-p20041"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-2004-10-f4.png","description":"Partially skeletonized version of the caliber P.2004 movement.","brand_id":"panerai","base":"panerai-p2004","reference":"P.2004/10","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":37.8,"jewels":29,"reserve":192,"frequency":28800,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Monopoussoir","hands":"Additional 12 Hour Hand (adjustable), Additional 24 Hour Hand (fixed), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"panerai-p200410"},{"picture":"","description":"Single-pusher chronograph movement with 8 days of power reserve and conventional (non-linear) indicator for said reserve.","brand_id":"panerai","base":"panerai-p2004","reference":"P.2004/6","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":37.8,"jewels":29,"reserve":192,"frequency":28800,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Monopoussoir","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"panerai-p20046"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-2004-9-96.png","description":"Single pusher chronograph with column wheel.

It has a second time zone in 12h format and an additional 24h indicator. The power reserve can be seen from the back.\n \nThe distinctive feature of the P.2005 calibre, entirely created by the Panerai Manufacture, is its sophisticated tourbillon regulator, a device originally designed for pocket watches, interpreted in an innovative way by Officine Panerai to achieve more accurate timekeeping. The tourbillon causes the balance wheel and escapement assembly to rotate continuously, thus correcting all the errors caused by gravity and possible friction. In the innovative Panerai tourbillon, the cage which contains the balance wheel and escapement rotates on an axis which is perpendicular to that of the balance wheel, rather than parallel to it. Additionally, while in a traditional tourbillon one rotation of the cage takes one minute, in the case of the Panerai P.2005 calibre the cage makes one rotation in 30 seconds. The greater speed and the particular arrangement of the balance wheel and escapement assembly enable it to compensate better for the running errors caused by the many vertical and horizontal positions of a wristwatch in the course of 24 hours. The tourbillon cannot be seen from the dial side, but is visible from the back of the watch; next to it is the indicator of the 6-day power reserve, displayed by a hand which moves in a circular arc. On the dial, however, as discreet proof of the presence and correct operation of the tourbillon, a small coloured disc is placed in the auxiliary small-seconds dial. Linked to the tourbillon cage, this disc moves at the same speed as the cage and therefore completes two rotations per minute.","brand_id":"panerai","base":null,"reference":"P.2005","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":36.6,"jewels":31,"reserve":144,"frequency":28800,"hands":"Additional 12 Hour Hand (adjustable), Additional 24 Hour Hand (fixed), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"panerai-p2005"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-2005-b-3e.jpg","description":"Version of P.2005 GMT Tourbillon movement with black galvanic coating.","brand_id":"panerai","base":"panerai-p2005","reference":"P.2005/B","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":31,"reserve":144,"frequency":28800,"hands":"Additional 12 Hour Hand (adjustable), Additional 24 Hour Hand (fixed), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"panerai-p2005b"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-2005-g-44.png","description":"The Panerai P.2005/G movement is one of the most complicated the brand has ever made.

In the system patented by Officine Panerai, the rotation of the tourbillon is different from that of the classic tourbillon. In the traditional version the balance cage rotates continuously on itself, limiting the variations caused by gravity. In the innovative Panerai mechanism, the tourbillon cage rotates on an axis which is perpendicular, not parallel, to that of the balance. Also, while the rotation is once a minute in a traditional tourbillon, in the P.2005/MR it takes 30 seconds, and this is shown by the indicator which rotates in the small seconds counter at 9 o’clock. The greater speed and the particular arrangement of the mechanism enable it to compensate very effectively for any potential changes of rate, ensuring very accurate timekeeping precision.

The power reserve is 8 days and this is displayed on the dial by a linear indicator. While sharing the vertical clutch of the chronograph, the P.2006 differs from the P.2004 calibre in that it has a second column wheel and two centre wheels, connected to the respective superimposed hands: the first and main one is the chronograph hand itself and the second is the split-seconds hand. The complex construction of the P.2006 calibre involves the use of special, highly resistant materials, in particular for the arbors of the chronograph hands, which are fitted one inside the other, and which are 14 mm long. The P.2006 calibre also has the seconds reset device which resets the seconds hand to zero, enabling the watch to be synchronized perfectly with a reference time signal. The operation of the system designed by Officine Panerai is unique: when the winding crown is pulled out to the second position, a thin blade moves into contact with the balance wheel, stopping it. At the same time, a small hammer lever moves downwards and acts on a heart-shaped cam which instantly moves the seconds hand to the zero position. As soon as the winding crown is returned to the normal position, the balance wheel is freed, the hammer lever is raised, thus releasing the cam, and the seconds hand resumes its normal course.","brand_id":"panerai","base":null,"reference":"P.2006/3","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":37.8,"jewels":34,"reserve":192,"frequency":28800,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Column wheel, Monopoussoir, Rattrapante","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator","id":"panerai-p20063"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/panerai/p-3000-21.png","description":"The P.3000 calibre, created entirely at the Panerai Manufacture, presents the main characteristics of the Panerai movements in terms of structure and robustness, accuracy and power reserve.

By using a wide range of solutions, specially devised for the individual parts of the movement and associated with the unique properties of carbon, the plates, bridges, barrels, escapement and anti-shock device use self-lubricating and dry lubricating materials, and are hence exempt from any liquid lubrication. To remove the need for further lubricating the main bridges and the plate, these components are made of a completely new material: a low friction composite which integrates a Tantalum based ceramic. This new generation of composite is notable for its high percentage of carbon which minimises pivot friction, making jewels and their related lubrication unnecessary. Also eliminated is the need to lubricate the escapement, as a result of making the main components from silicon and applying a special coating of DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) to the wheelwork. A good two years of testing by the Laboratorio di Idee in the Panerai Manufacture identified the best type of coating – based on carbon – with which to treat the components of the two spring barrels of the P.3001 calibre, so as to make conventional lubrication superfluous. The solution was to use a series of layers and sub-layers of coating, the surface one being coated with DLC.

Its original, very strong structure recalls that of old movements in which the mechanism was contained between two plates concealing most of the wheels and allowing only a few details to be seen, such as the balance cock and the intermediate wheel.\n\nThe P.5000 calibre has a variable inertia balance, its period of oscillation being adjusted by turning the little timing screws on the outside of the balance wheel. Using this system the balance spring is free, without the curb pins which would otherwise be used to modify its active length. The bridge supporting the balance is fixed by two screws beneath which are threaded rings which turn in both directions, the purpose of which is to adjust the endshake of the balance staff pivots. This technical solution helps the escapement to continue running perfectly in the event of shocks.\n\nThe long power reserve of 192 hours, that is 8 days, is achieved by coupling the two spring barrels with toothed rims in series. The twin assembly enables longer, thinner springs to be used, resulting in a longer duration and greater uniformity in delivering energy to the movement.","brand_id":"panerai","base":null,"reference":"P.5000","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":35.7,"jewels":21,"reserve":192,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","id":"panerai-p5000"},{"picture":"","description":"Hand-wound mechanical, P.5001 calibre, 15 ½ lignes, 5.5mm thick, 21 jewels, 21,600 alternations/hour.

It enables the escapement wheel to transmit power directly to the balance, leading to an efficiency increase. It is unique in that, in one direction, power is transmitted directly to the balance while in the other it is via the pallet fork, as in a traditional escapement. Both pallet fork and escapement wheel are made using MEMS technology.\n\nThe 9SA5 furthermore uses a new and special free-sprung balance developed for this caliber. It retains its precision for longer and is more resistant to shock and friction. While the current Caliber 9S uses a flat hairspring, 9SA5 uses an overcoil, whose curve shape was decided after more than 80,000 simulations with the result that its performance is optimized in every possible position. The uniqueness is that it can improve the isochronism. The secret lies in the precision manufacture of the components as well as the extraordinary adjustment skills of the watchmakers at the Grand Seiko Studio Shizukuishi.\n\nThe new caliber is 15% slimmer than the current Grand Seiko high beat caliber, thanks to the innovative horizontal layout of the barrel and gear trains.\n\nIn addition to these three new components, Caliber 9SA5 has other features that contribute to its extraordinary performance. Two barrels, arranged in sequence, enhance the power reserve, the date change is virtually instantaneous and the positioning of the winding stem close to the rotor allows the watch to sit closer to the wrist.","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"9SA5","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":31.6,"jewels":47,"reserve":80,"frequency":36000,"date":"Date","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","id":"seiko-9sa5"},{"picture":"","description":"Movement V157 is a solar powered quartz movement by Seiko.","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V157","movement":"Quartz","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"date":"Date, Day","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","additionals":"Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v157"},{"picture":"","description":"Caliber V172 is a solar-powered quartz movement by Seiko","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V172","movement":"Quartz","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"date":"Date","chronograph":"Chronograph","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","acoustic":"Alarm","additionals":"Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v172"},{"picture":"","description":"The V175 movement is a solar powered movement.","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V175","movement":"Quartz","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"chronograph":"Chronograph","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","additionals":"Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v175"},{"picture":"","description":"Caliber V172 is a solar powered quartz movement by Seiko.","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V176","movement":"Quartz","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"chronograph":"Chronograph, Rattrapante","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","additionals":"Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v176"},{"picture":"","description":"Caliber V192 is a solar powered quartz movement","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V192","movement":"Quartz","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"date":"Date","chronograph":"Chronograph","hands":"Additional 24 Hour Hand (adjustable), Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v192"},{"picture":"","description":"Movement V195 is a solar powered quartz movement by Seiko.","brand_id":"seiko","base":null,"reference":"V195","movement":"Quartz","display":"Analog","diameter":null,"jewels":null,"reserve":null,"frequency":null,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds, World Time","additionals":"Solar Charging","id":"seiko-v195"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/sellita/sw200-1-bd.png","description":"A real pillar of Swiss watchmaking, the SW200-1 is precise, reliable and robust.

The trademarked name comes from the Greek word iso, which means “equal”, and refers to the stable and consistent movement of the component.\n\nKnown as the heart of the mechanical watch because of its importance in the overall function, the hairspring is the most difficult part to produce. A team of TAG Heuer mathematicians, physicists and chemists are behind the creation of this newly reinvented hairspring. The carbon-composite hairspring improves the performance of watches fitted with the brand’s chronometer-certified movement. The key benefits of TAG Heuer’s carbon-composite hairspring include the fact that the lightweight, low-density hairspring is virtually unaffected by gravity and shock and is completely antimagnetic. Perfect concentric oscillations are made possible thanks to the hairspring’s geometry and improve the precision of the watch. Optimal thermal behaviour and aeroelasticity have been achieved by pairing the carbon-composite hairspring with an aluminium alloy balance wheel. The carbon-composite hairspring is produced with the collet already attached. TAG Heuer is the exclusive manufacturer of these hairsprings, which are designed and produced in its in-house laboratory in La Chaux-de-Fonds.\n\nIt can be based on either the ETA 2824-2 (25 jewels) or the Sellita SW200 (26 jewels).","brand_id":"tag-heuer","base":"eta-2824-2","reference":"Calibre 5 Isograph","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":25.6,"jewels":25,"reserve":38,"frequency":28800,"date":"Date","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Seconds","additionals":"Chronometer","id":"tag-heuer-calibre-5-isograph"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/tag-heuer/6-f8.png","description":"TAG Heuer Calibre 6 is a self-winding movement displaying hours, minutes, small seconds and date.

Four years proved necessary to solve this complex equation. While the new Calibre 1731 is barely thicker than its predecessor from 1993 – 3.90 compared with 3.28 mm – due to its impressive 65-hour power reserve, it is nonetheless the thinnest on the market today, having successfully overcome the difficulty of assembling and adjusting parts that have been slimmed down to extremes. Nor are the technical feats confined to the ultra-thin side of its nature, since Calibre 1731 is equipped with a highly ingenious device developed by Vacheron Constantin in 2007 for the 2755 movement – another member of this exclusive family of minute repeater calibres: a flying strike governor. Contrary to classic lever-type governors, this one is completely silent. Its role is to steady the rate at which the hammers strike the gongs. Without a regulator or governor, this musical sequence would take place at the speed of the striking barrel-spring, and would merely produce a rush of indiscernible notes. The device developed by Vacheron Constantin comprises two inertia-blocks or weights designed to act as a brake on the rotating shaft of the governor and thus evening out the energy supplied by the barrel spring. To achieve this, it makes use of two opposing centrifugal and centripetal forces. When the governor spins, the centrifugal force pivots one end of the weights outwards so that the other end presses on the shaft so as to stabilise the rotation speed and thus ensure a steady cadence. Perfectly finished right down to the smallest details, the governor bears Vacheron Constantin’s Maltese Cross emblem, even though the latter cannot be seen from the front of the calibre.","brand_id":"vacheron-constantin","base":null,"reference":"1731","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":32.8,"jewels":36,"reserve":65,"frequency":21600,"hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","id":"vacheron-constantin-1731"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/vacheron-constantin/1731qp-d6.jpg","description":"Hand-wound movement developed and manufactured by Vacheron Constantin, combining minute repeater and perpetual calendar functions  measuring just 5.70 mm thick.","brand_id":"vacheron-constantin","base":null,"reference":"1731QP","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":32.8,"jewels":36,"reserve":65,"frequency":21600,"date":"Date, Day, Leap Year, Month, Perpetual Calendar","hands":"Hours, Minutes","astronomical":"Moonphase","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","id":"vacheron-constantin-1731qp"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/vacheron-constantin/1860-d3.jpg","description":"Caliber 1860 was introduced in 2017.

Based on the 2460 base, it displays the position of the earth relative to the sun, with the earth rotating on its own axis as well. It consists of 352 components including 27 jewels.\n\nEntirely designed, developed and created by Vacheron Constantin in a three-year process, it provides the possibility of staging the fascinating view of the sky reproducing the heliocentric system. The time is displayed by two triangular peripheral hands in 4N gold – a cut-out one for the hours and a solid one for the minutes – that glide around the dial rim. These pointers are driven by large dedicated wheels positioned on the outer part of the calibre.\n\nThe elliptical path of the Earth around the Sun is a key highlight of this watch, exuding a powerful presence and providing continuous information as the days go by. The first complication takes the form of the Earth that spins on its axis in a 24-hour rotation period, corresponding to a mean solar day. The second complication achieved by means of a ‘tropical’ gear train is the Earth’s elliptical orbit around the Sun in 365.2421898 days, meaning one tropical year. An extremely precise mechanism, since the device operating this realistic motion of the Earth requires a one-day correction only once in 8,000 years – an eternity! This degree of precision for such a complication is a means by which the Maison testifies to its commitment to developing new movements. A tour de force serving as a timely reminder that the Manufacture has consistently demonstrated this capacity for innovation in terms of analogue time display, guided by its mastery of horological engineering as well as its creative boldness cultivated across more than 260 years.","brand_id":"vacheron-constantin","base":"vacheron-constantin-2460-sc","reference":"2460 RT","movement":"Automatic","display":"Analog","diameter":37,"jewels":27,"reserve":40,"frequency":28800,"hands":"Minutes, Hours","astronomical":"Planetarium","id":"vacheron-constantin-2460-rt"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/vacheron-constantin/2460-sc-3d.png","description":"Automatic movement with center seconds, minutes and hours, developed and crafted in-house by Vacheron Constantin.

A number of countries have indeed adopted a half-hour or quarter-hour difference from UTC, and the Calibre 2460WT by Vacheron Constantin takes account of these specific characteristics. By way of example, it provides the correct time indication for Caracas, since Venezuela decided in 2007 to switch from a full time zone to a half time zone (GMT – 4:30).\n\nThe indication of the 37 time zones as proposed by Vacheron Constantin in its Patrimony Traditionnelle World Time is as complete as one could wish for. The display consists of three dials: a sapphire dial with a unique day/night shading; a metal dial with a “Lambert projector” type map; and a metal chapter ring. Beating at a frequency of 4 Hz (28,800 vibrations per hour) and endowed with a 40-hour power reserve, mechanical self-winding Calibre 2460WT drives displays of the hours, minutes, central seconds and World Time. It enables simultaneous read-off of the time in all regions of the world, along with the day/night indication provided by the central world map.

This movement is certified with the Hallmark of Geneva. It has a power reserve indicator on the back. It consists of a total of 602 parts.\n\nCaught between the desire to extend the frontiers of technical possibility and concern over the practical use of this multi-complication movement, Vacheron Constantin’s engineers and watchmakers came up with an original device to regulate the repeater’s chiming rate: a centripetal governor. \n\nThe role of this device is to steady the rate at which the hammers strike the gongs of a chiming watch to repeat the hours, quarters and minutes in a series of notes. Without a regulator, the spring-driven strike would come out in a rush of indiscernible notes. \n\nThe device developed by Vacheron Constantin goes further than the more traditional strike regulator – a noisy recoil escapement with a lever that is subject to wear. \n\nDuring the development of the movement for the Tour de l’Ile anniversary watch of 2005, Vacheron Constantin’s engineers and watchmak-ers sought to replace the strike’s escapement governor with a totally silent system that would reduce wear. A centrifugal governor existed, essentially a flywheel with a pair of weights that moved away from the centre as it spun to slow the wheel by increasing its inertia. Nevertheless, true to the tradition of a brand whose motto recalls that it is always possible to do better, Vacheron Constantin’s watchmakers preferred to steer their choice towards a centripetal strike governor. \n\nThis device has two weights shaped so as to act as a brake on the governor’s rotating shaft, thus evening-out the energy released by the repeater’s spring. To achieve this, it uses the opposite centrifugal and centripetal forces. When the governor spins, the centrifugal force pivots one end of the weights outwards so that the other end acts as a brake on the central shaft to bring the rotation and the strike to a steady rate. This original and undoubtedly unique device is quite silent. The enthusiast can satisfy his curiosity while marvelling at the spinning governor through the sapphire-crystal caseback.","brand_id":"vacheron-constantin","base":null,"reference":"2755","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":33.9,"jewels":40,"reserve":58,"frequency":18000,"date":"Day, Month, Perpetual Calendar, Leap Year","hands":"Hours, Minutes, Small Seconds","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"vacheron-constantin-2755"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/vacheron-constantin/2755-acp-56.png","description":"Hand-wound movement with tourbillon, minute hand and one-hand display created for the Atelier Cabinotiers Philosophia.","brand_id":"vacheron-constantin","base":null,"reference":"2755 ACP","movement":"Handwound","display":"Analog","diameter":33.3,"jewels":40,"reserve":58,"frequency":18000,"hands":"Hours","astronomical":"Moonphase","acoustic":"Minute Repeater","additionals":"Power Reserve Indicator, Tourbillon Escapement","id":"vacheron-constantin-2755-acp"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/caliber/vacheron-constantin/2755-tmr-8.jpg","description":"Caliber 2755 TMR is designed, developed and produced by Vacheron Constantin.
