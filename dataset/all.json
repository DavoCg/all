Proceeds from this auction went towards helping children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS.\n\nThe unique timepiece was created in memory of the late Mr Duncan Wang, an American Chinese businessman and philanthropist who passed away at the age of 44 years in August 2009. The patron of Kidz Horizon Appeal and passionate watch collector was a great admirer of A. Lange & Söhne.\n\nFormed in 2004, the relief organisation raises funds for children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS, whose parents are not in a position to afford the medical treatment they need. The highlight of the annual fund raising efforts is a charity ball that is held annually at the Ritz Carlton Singapore.\n\nThe first ever Lange watch to be produced for a charity in Asia, the design of this unique version, showcasing dark/bright contrasts, is emphasised by a white-gold case, grey dial and numeral discs with white numerals, a black alligator leather strap and the folding clasp, also crafted from solid white gold.

In all, this masterpiece of tradition and vision, of technology and elegance reinforces the watchmaking prowess of Arnold & Son, and elevates its accomplishments to all new heights.\n\nIn typical Arnold & Son style, the watch is incredibly detailed and features superlative Haute Horlogerie finishing. The dial side of the timepiece offers symmetry and depth. It features two white lacquered domed dials - one each at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock - for the dual time displays. The two tourbillon escapements are harmoniously balanced at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock and seem to float over the dial thanks to their alluring raised 18-carat red gold bridges. The backdrop for these double lacquered dials and double tourbillon escapements is a magnificently decorated verticalCôtes de Genèvestripes plate.

The true beat seconds is a traditional complication of Arnold & Son, and this watch pays tribute to the watches produced by John Arnold during the second half of his career, when he and his son were the first to develop marine chronometers that could be produced in quantity at reasonable prices. Those technically superior, widely distributed chronometers reflected Arnold & Son's commitment to exceptional precision and solved the problem of determining longitude at sea.\n\nThe newly developed automatic movement showcases the true beat seconds' mechanism entirely on the dial side. Not just the hands, but also the lever, wheels and three rose-gold treated true beat seconds bridges are located in all their beauty on the dial side. Making the watch even more alluring is the fact that the true beat seconds lever is shaped like an anchor - paying homage to Arnold's maritime achievements. \n\nThe true beat seconds are superbly indicated via a large sapphire dial that occupies the top left portion of the dial at 11 o'clock. At the 4 o'clock position, a white lacquered domed subdial indicates the hours and the minutes via blued hands. These generously proportioned, overlapping indications translate into a stunning three-dimensional dial.","reference":"1ATAR.L01A.C120A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Instrument Collection","name":"DSTB","limited":"Yes, 50 units","caseMaterial":"Red Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":43.5,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"White","dialIndexes":"Roman Numerals","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands6003","id":"arnold-and-son-1atarl01ac120a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/instrument-collection/1tpar-s01a-c125a-7d.jpg","description":"This Time Pyramid follows the original regulators from the brand with its component positioning and detailed 3D visual appeal.

As a tribute to the Year of the Dragon, which occurs once every twelve years in the Chinese calendar and begins on 23 January 2012, Arnold & Son has created a special edition of the HMS1 in rose gold featuring an exquisitely crafted gold appliqué of a traditional Chinese dragon on a black lacquered dial.\n\nBut this is no ordinary dragon. The figure on the dial was inspired by one of the dragons depicted on the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai Park, an imperial garden to the northwest of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Wall was completed in 1756, which perhaps significantly was just eight years before John Arnold opened his clockmaking workshop in London's Strand in 1764. It just so happens that the number eight is of particular importance in many Asian cultures.\n\nThe exquisite gold dragon appliqué is created by a craftsman selected specially for his expertise in hand-engraving, a traditional art form that involves the use of hardened steel tools called burins in combination with other special tools. These create cuts, lines and texturing that build up entire images or, as in the case of the HMS1 Dragon Special Edition, a perfectly sculpted figure in solid 22-carat gold with a breathtaking richness of detail, which is then duplicated for the series. The three-dimensional nature of the dragon appliqué also provides a spectacular illusion of depth that contrasts starkly with the HMS1's ultra-slim case.","reference":"1LCAP.B02A.C111A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Royal Collection","name":"HMS1 Dragon","limited":"Yes, 50 units","caseMaterial":"Rose Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":40,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"Black","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands1001-cdg","id":"arnold-and-son-1lcapb02ac111a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/royal-collection/1lcap-u02a-c110a-8.jpg","description":"The HMS1 Royal Blue from Arnold & Son is an object of beauty and a worthy new member of the Royal Collection. Our designers and watchmakers took much of their inspiration for the new timepiece from a gold- and enamel-cased half-quarter repeating watch made by John Arnold in 1775, at a time when he had already established his reputation as an outstanding watchmaker with two miniature watches made for King George III. The outer case reflects the changeover from rococo to more classical design taking place at the time and was made by Mary Reasey, whose mark \"MR\" was registered at Goldsmith's Hall in 1773 and appears on the case.\n\nThe present model has a rose gold case and a translucent blue lacquered guilloché dial.","reference":"1LCAP.U02A.C110A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Royal Collection","name":"HMS1","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"Rose Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":40,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"Blue","dialFinish":"Guilloche","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands1001","id":"arnold-and-son-1lcapu02ac110a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/royal-collection/1lcap-s10a-c110a-f9.jpg","description":"The Royal Collection from Arnold & Son consciously references the magnificent timepieces made by John Arnold in his fledgling years as a watchmaker for King George III and members of the monarch's court.

Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches. The present Royal Oak is an example of this: the sporty and emblematic Royal Oak design is paired with an ultra-complex movement, and it's housed in handsomely crafted white gold case with a skeleton dial revealing much of the movements inner workings. How is that for merging tradition with an avant-garde mindset?\n\nSelfwinding watch with perpetual calendar indicating the day, the date, the week, the moon phases, the month and the leap years, minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph and small seconds at 9 o'clock.","reference":"26552BC.OO.D002CR.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Grande Complication Openworked White Gold / Strap","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"White gold","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":15,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Skeleton","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2885","id":"audemars-piguet-26552bcood002cr01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/15202or-oo-1240or-01-26.png","description":"The Royal Oak 'Extra-Thin' is Audemars Piguet modern Jumbo - the design closely following the original lines as introduced with the 1972 5402.

However, Audemars Piguet has been drawing rather heavily on its Royal Oak heritage in the last few years, causing the name to be almost synonymous with the decisively sporty and rugged Offshore for the almost a decade. Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches. The present Royal Oak is an example of this: the sporty and emblematic Royal Oak design is paired with an ultra-complex movement, though the emblematic look of Gerald Genta is still very much present.\n\nSelfwinding watch with perpetual calendar indicating the day, date, week, moon phases, month, leap years, minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph and small seconds at 9 o'clock. 18-carat white gold case, blue dial, 18-carat white gold bracelet.","reference":"25865BC.OO.1105BC.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Grande Complication White Gold / Blue","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"White gold","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":15,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Blue","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2885","id":"audemars-piguet-25865bcoo1105bc01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/26347pt-oo-d315cr-01-5.png","description":"Reference 26347PT.OO.D315CR.01 has a platinum case and an alligator strap; its calibre 2936 has a tourbillon escapement and chronograph complication - a signature combination for AP.","reference":"26347PT.OO.D315CR.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Tourbillon Chronograph Openworked Platinum","produced":"2016","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"Platinum","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Closed","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":13.2,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Skeleton","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2936","id":"audemars-piguet-26347ptood315cr01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/26322or-zz-1222or-01-32.png","description":"The Royal Oak Chronograph 41 was introduced in 2012, as an updated version of the previous 39mm Royal Oak Chronograph.

Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches.
