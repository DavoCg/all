Proceeds from this auction went towards helping children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS.\n\nThe unique timepiece was created in memory of the late Mr Duncan Wang, an American Chinese businessman and philanthropist who passed away at the age of 44 years in August 2009. The patron of Kidz Horizon Appeal and passionate watch collector was a great admirer of A. Lange & Söhne.\n\nFormed in 2004, the relief organisation raises funds for children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS, whose parents are not in a position to afford the medical treatment they need. The highlight of the annual fund raising efforts is a charity ball that is held annually at the Ritz Carlton Singapore.\n\nThe first ever Lange watch to be produced for a charity in Asia, the design of this unique version, showcasing dark/bright contrasts, is emphasised by a white-gold case, grey dial and numeral discs with white numerals, a black alligator leather strap and the folding clasp, also crafted from solid white gold.

In all, this masterpiece of tradition and vision, of technology and elegance reinforces the watchmaking prowess of Arnold & Son, and elevates its accomplishments to all new heights.\n\nIn typical Arnold & Son style, the watch is incredibly detailed and features superlative Haute Horlogerie finishing. The dial side of the timepiece offers symmetry and depth. It features two white lacquered domed dials - one each at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock - for the dual time displays. The two tourbillon escapements are harmoniously balanced at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock and seem to float over the dial thanks to their alluring raised 18-carat red gold bridges. The backdrop for these double lacquered dials and double tourbillon escapements is a magnificently decorated verticalCôtes de Genèvestripes plate.

The true beat seconds is a traditional complication of Arnold & Son, and this watch pays tribute to the watches produced by John Arnold during the second half of his career, when he and his son were the first to develop marine chronometers that could be produced in quantity at reasonable prices. Those technically superior, widely distributed chronometers reflected Arnold & Son's commitment to exceptional precision and solved the problem of determining longitude at sea.\n\nThe newly developed automatic movement showcases the true beat seconds' mechanism entirely on the dial side. Not just the hands, but also the lever, wheels and three rose-gold treated true beat seconds bridges are located in all their beauty on the dial side. Making the watch even more alluring is the fact that the true beat seconds lever is shaped like an anchor - paying homage to Arnold's maritime achievements. \n\nThe true beat seconds are superbly indicated via a large sapphire dial that occupies the top left portion of the dial at 11 o'clock. At the 4 o'clock position, a white lacquered domed subdial indicates the hours and the minutes via blued hands. These generously proportioned, overlapping indications translate into a stunning three-dimensional dial.","reference":"1ATAR.L01A.C120A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Instrument Collection","name":"DSTB","limited":"Yes, 50 units","caseMaterial":"Red Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":43.5,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"White","dialIndexes":"Roman Numerals","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands6003","id":"arnold-and-son-1atarl01ac120a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/instrument-collection/1tpar-s01a-c125a-7d.jpg","description":"This Time Pyramid follows the original regulators from the brand with its component positioning and detailed 3D visual appeal.

As a tribute to the Year of the Dragon, which occurs once every twelve years in the Chinese calendar and begins on 23 January 2012, Arnold & Son has created a special edition of the HMS1 in rose gold featuring an exquisitely crafted gold appliqué of a traditional Chinese dragon on a black lacquered dial.\n\nBut this is no ordinary dragon. The figure on the dial was inspired by one of the dragons depicted on the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai Park, an imperial garden to the northwest of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Wall was completed in 1756, which perhaps significantly was just eight years before John Arnold opened his clockmaking workshop in London's Strand in 1764. It just so happens that the number eight is of particular importance in many Asian cultures.\n\nThe exquisite gold dragon appliqué is created by a craftsman selected specially for his expertise in hand-engraving, a traditional art form that involves the use of hardened steel tools called burins in combination with other special tools. These create cuts, lines and texturing that build up entire images or, as in the case of the HMS1 Dragon Special Edition, a perfectly sculpted figure in solid 22-carat gold with a breathtaking richness of detail, which is then duplicated for the series. The three-dimensional nature of the dragon appliqué also provides a spectacular illusion of depth that contrasts starkly with the HMS1's ultra-slim case.","reference":"1LCAP.B02A.C111A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Royal Collection","name":"HMS1 Dragon","limited":"Yes, 50 units","caseMaterial":"Rose Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":40,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"Black","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands1001-cdg","id":"arnold-and-son-1lcapb02ac111a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/royal-collection/1lcap-u02a-c110a-8.jpg","description":"The HMS1 Royal Blue from Arnold & Son is an object of beauty and a worthy new member of the Royal Collection. Our designers and watchmakers took much of their inspiration for the new timepiece from a gold- and enamel-cased half-quarter repeating watch made by John Arnold in 1775, at a time when he had already established his reputation as an outstanding watchmaker with two miniature watches made for King George III. The outer case reflects the changeover from rococo to more classical design taking place at the time and was made by Mary Reasey, whose mark \"MR\" was registered at Goldsmith's Hall in 1773 and appears on the case.\n\nThe present model has a rose gold case and a translucent blue lacquered guilloché dial.","reference":"1LCAP.U02A.C110A","brand_id":"arnold-and-son","family":"Royal Collection","name":"HMS1","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"Rose Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":40,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"Blue","dialFinish":"Guilloche","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","caliber_id":"arnold-and-son-aands1001","id":"arnold-and-son-1lcapu02ac110a"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/arnold-son/royal-collection/1lcap-s10a-c110a-f9.jpg","description":"The Royal Collection from Arnold & Son consciously references the magnificent timepieces made by John Arnold in his fledgling years as a watchmaker for King George III and members of the monarch's court.

Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches. The present Royal Oak is an example of this: the sporty and emblematic Royal Oak design is paired with an ultra-complex movement, and it's housed in handsomely crafted white gold case with a skeleton dial revealing much of the movements inner workings. How is that for merging tradition with an avant-garde mindset?\n\nSelfwinding watch with perpetual calendar indicating the day, the date, the week, the moon phases, the month and the leap years, minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph and small seconds at 9 o'clock.","reference":"26552BC.OO.D002CR.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Grande Complication Openworked White Gold / Strap","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"White gold","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":15,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Skeleton","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2885","id":"audemars-piguet-26552bcood002cr01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/15202or-oo-1240or-01-26.png","description":"The Royal Oak 'Extra-Thin' is Audemars Piguet modern Jumbo - the design closely following the original lines as introduced with the 1972 5402.

However, Audemars Piguet has been drawing rather heavily on its Royal Oak heritage in the last few years, causing the name to be almost synonymous with the decisively sporty and rugged Offshore for the almost a decade. Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches. The present Royal Oak is an example of this: the sporty and emblematic Royal Oak design is paired with an ultra-complex movement, though the emblematic look of Gerald Genta is still very much present.\n\nSelfwinding watch with perpetual calendar indicating the day, date, week, moon phases, month, leap years, minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph and small seconds at 9 o'clock. 18-carat white gold case, blue dial, 18-carat white gold bracelet.","reference":"25865BC.OO.1105BC.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Grande Complication White Gold / Blue","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"White gold","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":15,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Blue","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2885","id":"audemars-piguet-25865bcoo1105bc01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/26347pt-oo-d315cr-01-5.png","description":"Reference 26347PT.OO.D315CR.01 has a platinum case and an alligator strap; its calibre 2936 has a tourbillon escapement and chronograph complication - a signature combination for AP.","reference":"26347PT.OO.D315CR.01","brand_id":"audemars-piguet","family":"Royal Oak","name":"Royal Oak Tourbillon Chronograph Openworked Platinum","produced":"2016","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"Platinum","caseShape":"Other","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Closed","caseDiameter":44,"caseHeight":13.2,"caseWR":20,"dialColor":"Skeleton","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"audemars-piguet-ap-2936","id":"audemars-piguet-26347ptood315cr01"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/audemars-piguet/royal-oak/26322or-zz-1222or-01-32.png","description":"The Royal Oak Chronograph 41 was introduced in 2012, as an updated version of the previous 39mm Royal Oak Chronograph.

Still, AP has a rich pedigree when it comes to complications and can be considered somewhat of a specialist when it comes to the traditional 'Grande Complication'.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. Audemars Piguet has been one of the first to merge its tradition in haute horlogerie with its tradition in sports watches, perhaps creating a new segment in the blink of an eye - that of extreme high-end, haute horlogerie sports watches.

Blancpain’s watchmakers undertook to bring to wristwatches, for the first time, the rare and difficult running equation complication that had existed only in large clocks and pocket watches. To do this they had to design an innovative gear train, with an ingenious differential that combines the running of the equation gear train controlled by a complex-shaped cam and the running train of the watch’s civil minutes-hand, to drive the running equation hand. In addition, caliber 3863 provides a plus/minus scale equation display. As befits this world’s first wristwatch, Blancpain combined these two separate equation displays with an innovative retrograde moon phase indication and a complete perpetual calendar. The decoration of the movement celebrates this achievement with a special hand carving of the bridges and a meticulously hand-fashioned winding rotor bearing an artist’s image of the sun.\n\nReference 6638-3431-55B has a platinum case and a white dial in grand feu enamel.","reference":"6638-3431-55B","brand_id":"blancpain","family":"Villeret","name":"Villeret Équation du Temps Marchante Platinum","produced":"2004","limited":"Yes, 88 units","caseMaterial":"Platinum","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":42,"caseHeight":11.5,"caseLugWidth":23,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"White","dialMaterial":"Enamel","dialIndexes":"Roman Numerals","dialHands":"Feuille","caliber_id":"blancpain-3863","id":"blancpain-6638-3431-55b"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/blancpain/villeret/6651-2987-55b-ba.png","description":"The Blancpain Ultraplate is a classical gentleman's wristwatch with a diameter of 40mm, powered by an extra-thin self-winding movement in the form of caliber 1151.\n\nReference 6651-2987-55B has a red gold case with diamond-set bezel.

To do this they had to design an innovative gear train, with an ingenious differential that combines the running of the equation gear train controlled by a complex-shaped cam and the running train of the watch’s civil minutes-hand, to drive the running equation hand. In addition, caliber 3863 provides a plus/minus scale equation display. As befits this world’s first wristwatch, Blancpain combined these two separate equation displays with an innovative retrograde moon phase indication and a complete perpetual calendar. The decoration of the movement celebrates this achievement with a special hand carving of the bridges and a meticulously hand-fashioned winding rotor bearing an artist’s image of the sun.\n\nReference 6638-3431-55B has a red gold case and a white dial in grand feu enamel.","reference":"6638-3631-55B","brand_id":"blancpain","family":"Villeret","name":"Villeret Équation du Temps Marchante Red Gold","produced":"2004","limited":"Yes, 188 units","caseMaterial":"Red Gold","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Open","caseDiameter":42,"caseHeight":11.5,"caseLugWidth":23,"caseWR":30,"dialColor":"White","dialMaterial":"Enamel","dialIndexes":"Roman Numerals","dialHands":"Feuille","caliber_id":"blancpain-3863","id":"blancpain-6638-3631-55b"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/blancpain/villeret/6639a-3631-55b-1d.png","description":"With the Villeret Quantième Complet 8 Jours, Blancpain paired its traditional triple date calendar with a modern and convenient 8 days of power reserve - and of course, the signature Blancpain moonphase.\n\nReference 6639A-3631-55B has a red gold case and white grand feu enamel dial with Arabic numerals.

The new Avenger is a perfect  illustration of this approach. Based on the solid Avenger platform and  reflecting all its attributes, its rugged construction includes a  screw-locked crown protected by substantial crown guards, pushpiece  reinforcements screwed into steel as well as a thick glare-proofed  sapphire crystal. The result is a case that is particularly shock and  water-resistant to 1,000 feet (300 meters/30 bars). The Avenger is also distinguished by its user-friendliness that not only guarantees excellent wearer comfort but also smooth handling of the crown and non-slip pushpieces. Meanwhile, the large hands facilitate reading off  the time in any conditions. Despite its top-flight performances, the most eye-catching feature of the Avenger is doubtless its unusual  aesthetic appeal. The sophisticated lines are accentuated by the high-tech look of its dial with ‘stencil’ numerals sporting an original  design.\n\nREF.

This unprecedented technical feat is based on the principle of the magnetic pushpiece, a patented technology exclusive to Breitling, which enables the user to activate the chronograph controls without any direct contact between the pushpiece and the movement. In other words, the function is controlled through the metal of the case. The Seawolf Chrono is a high-performance chronograph. Its sturdy steel case is equipped with a screw-locked crown and a decompression valve. The bezel, crown and pushpieces are easy to handle, even when wearing gloves. Oversized hands and a glareproofed sapphire crystal guarantee optimal readability in all circumstances. A special ‘yachting’ graduation on the dial serves to count down the ten minutes prior to a regatta start. The ultra precise Breitling Caliber 73 SuperQuartz™ movement measures short times to within 1/10th of a second as well as providing split-time indication.  \n\nREF.

The new Avenger is a perfect illustration of this approach. Based on the solid Avenger platform and reflecting all its attributes, its rugged construction includes a screw-locked crown protected by substantial crown guards, pushpiece reinforcements screwed into steel as well as a thick glareproofed sapphire crystal. The result is a case that is particularly shock and water-resistant to 1,000 feet (300 meters/30 bars). The Avenger is also distinguished by its user-friendliness that not only guarantees excellent wearer comfort but also smooth handling of the crown and non-slip pushpieces.

This unprecedented technical feat is based on the principle of the magnetic pushpiece, a patented technology exclusive to Breitling, which enables the user to activate the chronograph controls without any direct contact between the pushpiece and the movement. In other words, the function is controlled through the metal of the case. The Seawolf Chrono is a high-performance chronograph. Its sturdy steel case is equipped with a screw-locked crown and a decompression valve. The bezel, crown and pushpieces are easy to handle, even when wearing gloves. Oversized hands and a glareproofed sapphire crystal guarantee optimal readability in all circumstances. A special ‘yachting’ graduation on the dial serves to count down the ten minutes prior to a regatta start. The ultra precise Breitling Caliber 73 SuperQuartz™ movement measures short times to within 1/10th of a second as well as providing split-time indication.  \n\nREF.

The new Avenger is a perfect illustration of this approach. Based on the solid Avenger platform and reflecting all its attributes, its rugged construction includes a screw-locked crown protected by substantial crown guards, pushpiece reinforcements screwed into steel as well as a thick glareproofed sapphire crystal. The result is a case that is particularly shock and water-resistant to 1,000 feet (300 meters/30 bars). The Avenger is also distinguished by its user-friendliness that not only guarantees excellent wearer comfort but also smooth handling of the crown and non-slip pushpieces.

This genuine thoroughbred is distinguished by its sturdy, powerful and sophisticated lines, with a case boasting the respectable diameter of 48,4 millimeters. The Super Avenger is highly functional: the generous size of its dial and hands ensures optimal read-off of both the time and the measured times; the non-slip crown and pushpieces are extremely easy to handle. Despite its exceptional proportions, the Super Avenger is a very comfortable fit on the wrist: the Avenger platform on which it is built features an architectural structure renowned for its ergonomics. Like the other models in this range, it provides a well above-average of water resistance, since it is designed to withstand a pressure of 30 bars, or the equivalent of 300 meters (1.000 ft). To power this impressive chronograph, Breitling has chosen a mechanism well up to the task in the shape of the sturdy Caliber 13, the most tried and tested of all movements assembled by Breitling.\n\nREF.

Built on the sturdy Avenger platform, the Seawolf is also a functional success, since its dimensions have been kept very reasonable and offer perfect ergonomics, despite the technical constraints imposed by the need to withstand pressure of 300 bars.

To power this chronograph, Breitling has chosen a mechanism well up to the task in the shape of the sturdy Caliber 13, the most tried and tested of all movements used by Breitling.","reference":"A13371111C1S1","brand_id":"breitling","family":"Avenger","name":"Super Avenger II Stainless Steel / Mariner Blue / Rubber / Folding","produced":"2013","limited":"No","caseMaterial":"Stainless Steel","caseBezel":"Rotating, 0-60 (Dive)","caseShape":"Round","caseGlass":"Sapphire","caseBack":"Closed","caseDiameter":48,"caseHeight":17.75,"caseLugWidth":24,"caseWR":300,"dialNickname":"Mariner","dialColor":"Blue","dialIndexes":"Stick / Dot","dialHands":"Stick","caliber_id":"breitling-b13","id":"breitling-a13371111c1s1"},{"picture":"https://watchbase.r.sizr.io/watch/breitling/avenger/a1733110-bc30-106w-a20basa-1-1a.png","description":"The Breitling Avenger II Seawolf watch pairs a powerful look with exceptional performances.

Sixty years later, Breitling has revived the legend by presenting the Mark VI special series, a chronograph conceived in the spirit of tradition and performance characteristic of the entire Breitling for Bentley collection. In tribute to the heritage of excellence embodied by the famous limousine, this timepiece incorporates all the signature design features of the British manufacturer, such as the knurled finishing on the bezel, inspired by the Bentley controls. Merging know-how and elegance, it is graced with hour-markers cut from mother-of-pearl – a delicate work of fine craftsmanship – and the caseback is decorated with the Bentley emblem of the era, shown in relief. Created for individuals who are passionate about fine mechanical engineering, it is equipped with an exclusive Breitling for Bentley movement, selfwinding Calibre 26B with a 60-minute totalizer in the centre. This sophisticated mechanism is assembled in keeping with an extreme concern for reliability and precision, vouched for by the much-coveted COSC chronometer certification. The Mark VI comes in a steel version with platinum bezel as well as in a limited series in red gold.\n\nThis model is available with different straps, bracelets and dials.

This unique refinement is expressed through the daring cambered rectangular case reflecting the elegance of a coupé or a convertible; through the opulent, sophisticated design; as well as in the original display mode with jumping hours at 12 o’clock. Embodying unique expertise, the dial is a masterpiece of artistry and craftsmanship in its own right. It is distinguished by a wealth of details such as the knurled motif inspired by Bentley instrumentation, hour-markers sculpted from mother-of-pearl, or the subtle touch of colour in the central zone echoed in the jumping-hour window. The slightly cambered dial profile required a show of considerable ingenuity by the artisans, as did the curving shape of the bevelled sapphire crystal, glareproofed on both sides. Like all models in the Breitling for Bentley collection, the Flying B takes to the road with an exceptional motorisation: the Breitling Calibre 28B mechanical selfwinding movement, officially chronometer-certified by the COSC. The Flying B is crafted in steel, in a prestigious red gold version, as well as in a white gold series representing the ultimate expression of discreet luxury.

Upon changing timezone, simply turning the crown forward or backward in one-hour increments serves to correct all indications in one smooth gesture, with the date automatically adjusted to local time. The 24-city bezel comprises indications serving to take account of “summer” or Daylight Saving Time (DST). The black or matt white dial is adorned with an artistically sculpted globe accentuating the travel theme. The high-performance chronograph movement, chronometer-certified by the COSC (Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute), measures feats accomplished the world over. It is driven by a highly original oscillating weight shaped like a wheel rim and visible through the transparent caseback.
