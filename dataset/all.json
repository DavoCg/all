Proceeds from this auction went towards helping children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS.\n\nThe unique timepiece was created in memory of the late Mr Duncan Wang, an American Chinese businessman and philanthropist who passed away at the age of 44 years in August 2009. The patron of Kidz Horizon Appeal and passionate watch collector was a great admirer of A. Lange & Söhne.\n\nFormed in 2004, the relief organisation raises funds for children suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS, whose parents are not in a position to afford the medical treatment they need. The highlight of the annual fund raising efforts is a charity ball that is held annually at the Ritz Carlton Singapore.\n\nThe first ever Lange watch to be produced for a charity in Asia, the design of this unique version, showcasing dark/bright contrasts, is emphasised by a white-gold case, grey dial and numeral discs with white numerals, a black alligator leather strap and the folding clasp, also crafted from solid white gold.
